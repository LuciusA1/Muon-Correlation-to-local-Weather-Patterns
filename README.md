# Big-Data-Analysis-using-MATLAB-Connections-Between-Atmospheric-Muon-Count-and-Local-Weather-Pattern
A project using Matlab programming to figure out correlative figures in local atmosphere in regards to Muon subatomic particles. 
we discuss how local weather factors exactly affect these subatomic particles
